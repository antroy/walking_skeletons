Spring Boot RESTful Web Service
-------------------------------

This skeleton provides a simple no-auth RESTful web service. The mvnw wrapper (https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) is provided for a quick start.

The initial project was generated using the useful http://start.spring.io/ online tool.
